<h1>Task 1 </h1>

This code will create a responsive product carousel that will automatically rotate through the featured products and allow for manual navigation using arrow buttons. The carousel is made up of three main components:

The carousel container, which holds all of the other carousel elements.
The carousel inner, which contains the carousel items.
The carousel items, which are the individual product cards.
The carousel uses CSS to style the carousel elements and JavaScript to handle the automatic rotation and manual navigation.

Here is a brief explanation of my approach:

I used HTML to create the basic structure of the carousel.
I used CSS to style the carousel elements.
I used JavaScript to handle the automatic rotation and manual navigation.
